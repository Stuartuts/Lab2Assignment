Type of Collision Check: Robot-Environment Collision Detection

Description:

The primary purpose of this code is to check whether the robot (represented by its joints and links) collides with its surrounding environment, including potential obstacles or surfaces. The result of the collision check is a boolean value (True or False) that indicates whether a collision has occurred.
Key Components and Operations:

Loop Over Joint Configurations:

The code iterates through different joint configurations (self.qMatrix) for the robot, examining how the robot's position changes with varying joint values.
Calculate Transformations:

The GetLinkPoses function is used to calculate the transformation matrices for each link in the robot's arm. These transformations represent the pose (position and orientation) of each link.
Check for Collision:

For each joint configuration, the code examines each link and checks for collisions with the environment. It does so by comparing the robot's links to a plane described by a face normal and a vertex on the plane.
The LinePlaneIntersection function is used to check if a line segment (representing a robot link) intersects with the plane. If an intersection is found, it implies a collision.
Collision Detection Strategy:

The code primarily relies on a line-plane intersection test to detect collisions. It checks whether the robot's links intersect with a plane representing a potential collision surface.
If any intersection is found for a particular link in a specific joint configuration, the collision count (result) is incremented.
Result:

The result variable accumulates the number of collisions detected. If result remains zero after checking all joint configurations, it indicates that there are no collisions.
Note:

The exact implementation may depend on the details of the LinePlaneIntersection function and the specific robot's kinematics and geometry. Proper collision detection in robotics is a critical aspect to ensure the robot's safe operation in various environments.
